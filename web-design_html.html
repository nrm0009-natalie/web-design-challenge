                    <p class="paragraph">The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather 
                        changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this 
                        analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to
                        assemble a datasest on over 500 cities.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various
                            aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Factors we looked at included:
                            temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source 
                            data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations
                            and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.
